I'm asked this question often: how can I learn to code? Since a lot of people are interested, here are some tips on how to get started.

**First, why?**  
Learning to code drastically changed the course of my life for the better. Everything you do -- from watching Netflix to sharing cat memes, ordering takeout, and checking your bank account -- is powered by technology. Every major industry has been disrupted by software. In short, [software will eat the world.](https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) Give yourself a shot at thriving in the 21st century and learn to code.
If you still need more convincing, you should know that overall, developers are highly compensated, highly employable, and have a lot of freedom and flexibility -- as far as taking time off, working remotely, starting their own companies, building their own apps, or working for any company in the world. In addition to all of that, coding can be pretty fun.

**What should I learn?**  
Assuming you're starting from Square 0, I think these are two of the most basic and important technologies all developers should know:

*1. The Command Line*  
The command line is how most developers navigate their os. If you've ever seen a movie where some hacker is furiously typing into a black box on a computer screen, they're typing into a command line. You'll need to learn to traverse directories, move files, edit your executable path, and simply get comfortable using CLIs.

*2. Git*  
Git is a version control system: it's how developers track and manage changes to their projects, and how they collaborate.

You'll also need to download a text editor. I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

What you want to learn next largely depends on what kind of developer you want to be. For example, if you want to be an iOS developer, you'll need to know Objective-C or Swift. For Android, look up Java tutorials. Aspiring data engineers probably want to learn Python. To get into game development, you may have to learn C++ or C#. If you already know specifically what you want to do, look up the common tech stacks and languages used in that industry and search for online tutorials in those languages.

If you have no idea what kind of developer you want to be, you're in luck: **it doesn't really matter what you learn first**. Just pick a language and get started. Once you learn one language, it isn't hard to learn another.

That being said, I'm mostly a web developer. Here are the languages I started out with (and that I still program in today). They are extremely beginner-friendly and powerful enough to build your career on:

*1. Ruby*  
*2. Javascript*  
*3. SQL*  
*4. HTML*  
*5. CSS*  

**Where do I get started?**  
You should search online for beginner tutorials in whatever language you're trying to learn (i.e., googling "How to learn Ruby", "Beginner Ruby tutorials"). There is _plenty_ of material; if you can't find it, you're not searching hard enough. In addition to that, I started with [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and have heard good things about [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) and [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/). A lot of these online platforms have free trial periods or offer a few free courses. I would start with those and any other free tutorials you can find; if you like it, consider paying for a subscription. There are also several organizations that offer free or low-cost workshops. [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters) and [Railsbridge](http://www.railsbridge.org/) are two such programs that I have mentored and volunteered for.

**Should I Attend a Coding Bootcamp?**  
No matter what, you should start using free online tutorials to see if you _enjoy_ the basics of coding. After that, start looking into more dedicated programs. As far as whether or not you should attend a coding bootcamp, the answer is "it depends." Thousands of people, including myself, have had a lot of success attending bootcamps. It is possible to be entirely self-taught, but nothing can replace in-person learning with teachers, mentors, and peers on hand to help you. However, the barrier to entry is high: a lot of programs are expensive and require near full-time committment. And now that bootcamps have proven to be successful, a lot of new ones are springing up, and it is difficult to gauge the quality of any one program. I was lucky enough to attend the now-defunct [Dev Bootcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_Bootcamp) in 2014 and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Your mileage may vary -- you'll have to weigh the costs and make your own decision. In a future blog post, I'll expand upon some tips for vetting a coding program.  

**Final Thoughts**  
Like everything else in life, you are going to get out what you put in. If you are unsure of what you're learning, unsure of where this will take you, and confused most of the time, you're probably doing it right. You are not too old, you are not too dumb, and it is not too late. You do not need any prior knowledge to get started; that's why it's called "getting started." Go now. Don't look back.
