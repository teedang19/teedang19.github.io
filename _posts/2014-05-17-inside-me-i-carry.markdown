I used to carry little pouches of loneliness around with me.  It was a tender, forlorn time of my life.  I would hold myself at night and say, “You have no one now - only yourself, this is the reality forever.  You must make yourself enough.  Little baby self inside, who feels too much, don’t worry. You can do this.”  I cried every day for seven months, maybe more, every single day I opened this pouch of loneliness and stared.  I felt forsaken, beaten, small.  That was a little over a year ago. I reflect on that time period quite a bit, and all of the bad periods before it (my early 20s had some seriously crappy shit in them) and I am so grateful to be in a place now where I value how much I’ve grown from going through that. In periods of intense sadness and pain, there is so much opportunity for strength and courage and beauty and growth.

I didn’t articulate that as well as I’d like, but I wanted to utter this little prayer out into the universe, just in case someone reads it, even if that someone is only future-me … I want these little words to be here.  If you are going through something awful, if you feel small and beaten and lonely, if every night you think you’ll never wake up a person again and every moment you think might shatter you, just know I’ve been there. I’ve been there, I’ve been there, some part of me will always be there, and if you want, I’ll sit there with you a while.  I want you to know that you can be so great.  You can be brave and do things you’ve never done before.  You can dig yourself out of the loneliest, smallest holes … You can create a new life for yourself, you can find happiness and love for yourself, you can teach yourself new things, you can carve opportunity where there is seemingly none.  You can do all of these things.  Until you get there, know: I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ll sit with you.

"oh, God, inside me I carry a black
night you climb through like
the moon in which the Asians
see a woman:
higher

and smaller, farther
and farther away,
and nothing
will ever bring you back.
And nothing will ever get rid of you.”
