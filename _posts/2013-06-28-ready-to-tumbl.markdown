First time having a tumblr, the creation of which was prompted by my acceptance into Dev Bootcamp.  They suggest you create one to keep track of the experience, which is supposed to be quite the emotional and intellectual cornucopia.  I am pretty damn excited, though I do not start for 276 days (I have a countdown on my phone).  I’m in the Mar 31st cohort in Chicago…. in the meantime, I plan to teach myself as much as possible, which I’ve been doing since mid-April with completely respectable results.  What’s on the menu? I’m currently building a text-based adventure game, working through the “Learn Ruby the Hard Way” website (I’m on Ex. 38) as well as “Chris Pine’s Learn to Program”, and I’m gonna look up some resources that focus on recursion, RegEx, & OOP.  Very exciting stuff, albeit occasionally frustrating.  There are many disadvantages of trying to teach yourself, but the major upswing is the self-pride I have when I realize how far I’ve come, all on my own!  Seriously, it’s a self-esteem/confidence booster, something that is productive and healthy for everyone in moderate doses, especially when it’s brought about by one’s own hard work, and something that has been healthy and positive for me, especially, lately.
