I am a capable learner.  I like to think myself diversely framed… calculus, literature, french, programming, even kinesiology (at one point, I knew all the muscles in the body and their origins, insertions, and actions).  All of these skills I acquired quickly and easily, and I retain information quite well, no matter how long it’s been since I last challenged my little brain (and seemingly, uh, no matter how much tree I smoke).  I’m grateful.

At DBC we discuss different states of mind while learning new material: comfort, comfort learning, stretch, and panic.  I’m almost never in the panic zone.  I’m way too zen at heart. (“Hey man, it’s all good.  I love you.”) Frustration, apathy, fatigue — these are cycles I move through, but never panic.  I’ve got a near-perfect track record in being a badass when learning new things.

I think these learning zones apply outside the world of academic material though, and this is where my track record starts to crumble.  As hippie as I am, I am terrible at breaking free of the constructs of my identity.  How can you grow as a person if you never open yourself to new things?  It’s a terrifying challenge.  We cling to the familiar.  Take away my books and, oh God, who am I?  Poetry, programming, knowledge, music, marijuana.  My name is Tam. I have friends,  their names are A and P and K.  I live in Chicago, I have a cat, I have a past, I make mistakes, I am funny, I am confident as hell. I like to watch The Walking Dead, I had a boyfriend for seven years, I like to cook food from scratch and write code … but who the fuck am I?

These are things I exude like pillars of my ego .. the identity badges I wear proudly in life.  Earthly constructs are easy to cling to.  They are physical, describable, non-elusive; they are socially understood relationships that come with socially-constructed expectations into which we can fit.  They are present like we think we are present.  And when they change, fade, or lose their superficial or external meaning, I start to panic.  I had to give away at least 100 books when I moved to Chicago (they wouldn’t fit in my car) and I felt like I was giving away my self.  I thought my dad was dying last year and the sight of a napkin holder threw my psyche in a dark existential loop.  Why the fuck do we cling to these meaningless things?  Why do we get mad at people we love when they don’t live up to our expectations?  Why the fuck do we need a fucking shitty ceramic apparatus to sit on our dining room tables and hold our fucking napkins so neatly for us?

We’re more than the sum of our actions, our feelings, all of the things we store in our houses and carry in bags.  It is a serious panic moment when we change the things we carry in our metaphysical bags.  I nearly fainted my first day alone in Chicago.  I don’t usually do these things.  I’ve never lived here before, never known these people before, never been on my own for too long.  I’ve been the same person for so long now, it was so easy and I did it well.  I was afraid for things to be different.  Now they’re different and I’m still afraid, I panic. But there’s learning to be done, there is growth to be had, and I am going to have it.

"I don't want you to be afraid  
as we stand here losing  
our lives, unable to speak,  
soon to enter the dream  
of once having touched  
this portion, that smoothness  
of flesh now buried dead  
and having heard the lovely  
tones ascending on a voice  
merely speaking; there is  
the chance there will be  
the singing of the voiceless,  
unraveling into the unenclosed  
emptiness a silence  
drawn taut so  
slowly its  
high music encounters  
us before  
it begins, and we are dancing."
