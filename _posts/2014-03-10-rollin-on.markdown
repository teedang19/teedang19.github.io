Less than a week until I move to Chicago (6 days).  I haven’t packed yet, and I’m behind on weekly assignments.  I’ve felt a lack of motivation to catch up and an urge to delay the inevitable.  Some days I just want everything to slow down so I can take a breather, tell myself this is really happening, hold on to my boyfriend and my puppy and my current life for just a little bit longer before I say goodbye indefinitely.  Some days I just want to not code at all, take a walk outside, soak in the present moment and my present comfort zone before it all changes.  This is just fear.  Don’t worry, I won’t listen to it.  I won’t listen to it!

Some people analyze every detail.
Some people stall when they can’t see the trail.
Some people freeze out of fear that they’ll fail,
but I keep rollin’ on.

Some people can’t get success with their art.
Some people never feel love in their heart.
Some people can’t tell the two things apart ..
but I keep rollin’ on.
