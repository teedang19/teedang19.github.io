This is my first blog post powered by Jekyll. In the interest of keeping Iteration 0 as simple as possible, I will only try to print the following ruby block with code highlighting, and call it a success.

{% highlight ruby %}
def hello
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

# very original.
{% endhighlight %}
