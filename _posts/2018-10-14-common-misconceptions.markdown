I've found there is a lot of confusion around what it takes to be a software developer and what software developers _do_. At best, these ideas are silly and inaccurate; at worst, they are deterrents to getting more diverse people involved in tech -- something the industry desperately needs. Here's my take on some common misconceptions about being a developer.

**1. It is "hard" and requires you to be very "smart"**  
Most things worth doing will be difficult at first, when you have the least amount of knowledge about how to do them. Programming is no different. Throw away the idea that you aren't "smart" enough; the only purpose that sentiment serves is to deter you from trying. Furthermore, being "smart" is neither a useful nor quantifiable measure of what it takes to achieve something -- it's just some notion you have about yourself or other people that feeds your bias. Does programming require you to be "smart"? I don't know. What it does require is patience, attention to detail, logic, and an enjoyment of problem solving. All of these are skills you can learn and practice.

**2. You have to be good at math**  
I once presented on this subject as a lightning talk at work, and when I read this point aloud, all the developers in the room laughed (because it's trueG. For some reason, people think you have to be a mathematician in order to tell computers what to do nowadays. I do no math in my day-to-day work. There are probably some kinds of developers that need a deep understanding of math -- like maybe data scientists? Honestly I don't know. But the point is, if you don't want to do any math, you don't have to. Like, at all.

**3. It is boring and you do the same thing everyday**  
Some days I wish there was truth to this statement. However, this is entirely false. Every day I am presented with new problems or features we need, and it is my job to solve those problems with code. Every day, I have no idea -- or only a very vague, faint idea -- of _how_ I am actually going to do my job that day, of _how_ I am going to solve the problem in front of me. And then what I do is a bit of research, collaboration, and trial and error until all of a sudden: bam -- I've written a working solution. Every day is a different challenge, and while it can certainly be overwhelming and intimidating, it can also be extremely rewarding and engaging.

**4. You spend all of your time sitting alone at a computer**  
I think this is just something people say to talk themselves out of being interested. Most jobs these days require a lot of sitting on a computer anyway; you might as well learn a bit about how it works. Sure -- I spend a lot of my time solo at a computer. But I also spend it at whiteboards, brainstorming ideas with other people and collaborating with devs and non-devs alike. I spend it drawing out diagrams on paper to help me understand complex systems. I spend it reading up on the latest technologies and updates in open source. I spend it at tech conferences, hearing industry leaders speak and networking with fellow coders. Abandon the image of you being isolated and hunched over your laptop all day. It's not accurate.

**5. You have to be a fast typer**  
Coding is not a typing game. When solving a problem, I am not furiously cranking out some huge-winded monolith of code I have in my head. I'm usually writing a line or two at a time, then sitting back, thinking, moving things around, taking a break, and trying again -- one small piece at a time. You may observe devs being extremely adept typers, deftly and quickly navigating their systems, but that's because they're used to working in their environments. Don't be insecure about your typing skills. You don't need to be "good" at typing to be a developer, but because you'll be typing, you'll naturally get better at it.

**6. What we do is "magic"**  
You can do amazing things with code, and it may seem like magic when you're not aware of how it works. But it's not magic. It's strict logic, reasoning, and detailed sets of instructions. That's it.

**7. You have to have been doing this your whole life in order to be any good at it**  
I think this idea is fueled by the stereotypical portrayal of programmers: crusty white dudes who have been tinkering with computers since they could crawl, stuffing their mouths with Doritos and downing soda in their parents' basement in front of multiple computer screens. This is just silly. I started learning to code when I was 24. Before that, I had never built a website, never created or modeled a database, never navigated my OS via terminal, nothing. I went to school for Creative Writing and French. When I started learning to code, I was working at a car dealership, answering the phone and alphabetizing paperwork. Abandon the idea that you are already too far behind, or that you need some baseline of technical knowledge in order to get going, or that you don't fit the mold of a successful hacker. It isn't true. You don't need to do anything except start.

In closing, I'll say that I don't think programming is for everyone, nor do I think it's more valuable or worthwhile than anything else (like literature, or art, or musicianship). Nothing is for _everyone_, and if you find you don't like it, don't do it. That being said, most things worth doing will seem difficult and mystical until you put the work in. _Can_ you be a developer? All you have to do to find out is try.
