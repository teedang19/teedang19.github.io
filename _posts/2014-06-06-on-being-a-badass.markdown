I graduated DBC last Friday and I’m partaking in Career Week right now. We’re given tips on interviewing, networking, and general advice on breaking into the tech industry. As I exit the bubble of DBC life and step into the dialogue of the tech wilderness (read: Twitter), I notice one conversation in which I inevitably must take part, at least internally: the treatment and perception of women in the industry.

I don’t enjoy speaking externally on this topic. It is wrought with such fierce opinion and judgement that I think most contributions just compile into the vast chaotic din - not really the type of avenue into which I send my careful thoughts and voice.  It’s also difficult for me to identify with the movement to support women in tech as opposed to identifying with and supporting actual women in tech. (I distance myself from all movements, as a rule.) Sometimes I feel guilty for this.  As a female, am I being too classically silent? Shouldn’t I be vocal and occasionally outraged?

(If there’s one thing I’m peeved about, it’s the content of the conversations I see.  What is emphasized most is the unfair treatment of women.  Rarely is it explicitly emphasized that injustice to women is injustice to one and all. The true message of equality requires an unyielding compassion and love that is often omitted from discussions: a disservice to you is a disservice to me.)

I withdraw from these conversations not because I don’t care, but because I don’t think non-intimate conversations (industry-wide or Twitter-fed) are impactful. I’m also secretly on-the-fence about organizations that imply exclusive support of women.  Even as I say that, I feel a pang of remorse — but I think that sometimes, having deliberate all-women groups and panels perpetuates the disconnect between men and women and our ideal reality.

I encounter sexism daily.  I prefer to steamroll over all of it and continue kicking ass as I choose.  I kick so much ass.  And as I start this journey, I don’t want people to look at me and think, “She’s a female entering tech. We need her. She’s gonna have tough moments, but she’s gonna be great.” I just want to program. I just want to run past people who aren’t listening or who aren’t aware and support the people who are.  I think this is the real effort and the real value.  I was going to label this post “on being a woman” — but why? The distinction is irrelevant until the moment we emphasize it as a distinction. Rather: it is, quite simply, one strong facet of a continual, communal march forward.
