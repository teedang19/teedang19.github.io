So you're interested in learning to code. You've heard of coding bootcamps: short-term, accelerated programs designed to teach you the skills to land an entry-level developer job. You're thinking of enrolling in one. However, the program you're looking at is costly, and you're trying to determine if it's worth it. This post will help you decide if a particular bootcamp will be worth your time, effort, and money.

First, some background. In March 2014, I attended [Dev Bootcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_Bootcamp). I believe it was the first on-site coding bootcamp. It was a huge risk: coding bootcamps were sparse and experimental back then. I wasn't even _entirely_ certain what I was going to learn -- I had no prior programming knowledge. Dev Bootcamp gave you no degree, not even a certificate, and didn't guarantee you'd find employment. They promised it would be difficult and time-consuming, 60-80 hours of work per week, and that you absolutely could not hold a job at the same time. I quit my job at a New Jersey car dealership and moved to Chicago, by myself, to do it. The program was 9-12 weeks of remote prep work, followed by 9 weeks of on-site classes. The tuition was nearly $13,000, which I funded using several credit cards (because bootcamps are not accredited institutions, there is no financial aid). The focus was on web development: HTML, CSS, Git, SQL, Javacript, Ruby, and Rails. I graduated May 31st and accepted a job as a junior developer one month later. It was the best decision I have ever made in my life.

**That being said: your mileage may vary.**

Unfortunately, Dev Bootcamp shut down in 2017. However, the bootcamp-style education model has proven to be successful and profitable -- as a result, a whole host of other similar programs have sprung up, varying in course material, cost, duration, curriculum style ... you name it. They are not all created equal, and I'm certain there are less-than-reputable programs out there now. It is overwhelming to try to decide between any two progams, let alone make the decision to _go_ -- especially if, like me, you are uncertain of what you're even looking for. Here are some tips on gauging whether or not a particular coding program will be worth it.

**1. Google things**  
Pretty self explanatory. Your looking for reviews, personal stories, horror stories, articles, press releases.

**2. Research alumni and current students online**  
I would suggest first doing a search on LinkedIn to find people who have attended the program you're interested in. If you can't find anyone on Linked In, that's potentially a bad sign -- but you should continue the search on other social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Before I attended DBC, I was looking through all posts tagged with #Devbootcamp on any social media site I could find. You basically need to be a stalker.

**3. Ask the alumni or the professors if you can meet them for coffee**  
Once you find some people connected to the school, you should reach out to them.

**4.Reach out to the school i**  

**4. Ask for a tour of the space before showing up**  

**5. Ask the school for detailed information**
