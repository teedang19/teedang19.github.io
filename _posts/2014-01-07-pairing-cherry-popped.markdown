I am exhausted, mentally.  Today I did my first  pairing session via Skype,  it went really well and I’m happy about it.  During the actual session, I was very engaged, present, and  enjoying the coding moment.  It was valuable to be present for the awkwardness that arises in talking to someone you don’t know about a topic you don’t know much about.

After the session ended, I reflected for a few, and still felt quite good and buzzy.  Soon enough though some anxiety set in.  I have so many things on my plate right now.  Before I even began the coding journey I remember feeling stretched thin, so now that I’m throwing coding into the mixture, eek.  Not sure if it is a self-fulfilling prophecy or not — as in, if I put myself in this situation, or if this is really the situation I’m always in.  I probably put myself here.  It’s something I should work on.  I am a work & stress-aholic … mostly because I know I am good at getting things done. Rambling.

Everything will be fine.  I will find a place to live in Chicago.  The toothache and resultant headache that I am experiencing from yesterday’s molar extraction (yikes) will fade away.  My laundry will get done, my room will be cleaner, I will have enough money to complete this coding journey, and my self and my relationships will remain intact.  I will go to work tomorrow and get my stuff done, then I will come home and get some coding done…. because that’s what I do.  I am truly a lucky and talented person.
