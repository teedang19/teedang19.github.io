I believe language shapes reality.

I live in Chicago, IL with my two cats. Currently, I sling code for [Reverb.com](https://reverb.com). I like to write, ride my bike, and read (poetry, prose, graphic novels). I also train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

If you'd like to connect about any of these things, feel free to [@me](https://twitter.com/tamatojuice) or [send an email](mailto:teedang19@gmail.com).
